## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL hues that reflect finance and growth are typically green, but given the potential boredom this might cause for the user, an unconventional but related analogous hue will serve nicely; choose yellow-green (#8BC34A) for a sense of optimism.
- Background color: Light background in a similar hue, about 20% saturation, resulting in a soft sage (#F1F8E9).
- Accent color: A lighter yellow (#FFEB3B) to highlight key actions and information.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons representing financial concepts, such as charts, money, and reports.
- A clean, intuitive layout with clear navigation, designed for ease of use on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as loading animations and chart updates.
